// Axis: Integrator (the target function).
//
// What "contribution" means for ReSTIR DI: the target p̂_q(y) a light sample
// y is weighed by at surface q, ignoring what may be in the way. The
// Integrator owns it (change-axes.md: the target function belongs with the
// light transport it stands for); the candidates, every merge and every Z
// test call this one definition (ES.3), so none can weigh a sample one way
// and normalize it another.
//
// Depends on contracts 2, 4 and 5, Material's packed form and the shared
// unit-vector map, and the Integrator's own Shading; nothing of Sample
// reuse. The merges reach it only through the Frame the
// composition passes them (metal/reuse/unbiased.metal.h;
// metal/passes/restir_di/restir_di.metal.h), so a change to the merges
// changes nothing here, and a change here none of their headers.
//
// The target, for surface record q (contracts/surface_record.h), unpacked,
// and the light at y as evaluate_light_point() gives it at y's decoded point
// (contracts/light_sample.h):
//
//   p̂_q(y) = luminance(f(wo, wi) |cos θ_x| L_e) x max(cos θ_y, 0) a / d^2
//
// f the record's unpacked Bsdf at its unpacked wo (contracts/bsdf.h,
// unpack_bsdf), wi and d the direction and distance from q's point to y's,
// θ_x between wi and q's shading normal, θ_y at the light, between its normal
// at y and -wi, and a the light's area scale. That is f |cos| L_e G with G
// the geometry term into the measure the sample lives in, area on the light
// in its own coordinates (light_sample.h), dω = cos θ_y a dA / d^2: one
// sample means one thing at every surface and in every frame, so a weight
// from last frame's surface, or a neighbor's, is in the same units as this
// one's (Bitterli et al. 2020 shift samples between pixels unchanged: the
// shift is the identity, in a measure all pixels share). Luminance by
// Rec. 709's weights, 0.2126, 0.7152 and 0.0722, the radiance's primaries
// being sRGB's.
//
// Any target with the integrand's support makes the estimator unbiased; this
// one is the integrand without visibility and transmittance, which makes it
// the best that needs no ray (the paper's choice). Its support is the
// integrand's: f > 0, L_e > 0 and y on the side of the light that faces q;
// what visibility removes is accounted for by Z (metal/reuse/
// unbiased.metal.h), and a medium's transmittance, never 0, by the shade.
//
// The density a candidate is drawn with, in the same measure: Light
// selection's probability of its light, times the emitter's density per
// solid angle of the direction toward y (contract 3, light_pdf), times
// cos θ_y a / d^2. A candidate's weight p̂ / p then needs neither cos θ_y
// nor d: they cancel, and the weight is luminance(f |cos θ_x| L_e) over the
// selection probability and the solid-angle density, finite at the light's
// rim, where cos θ_y goes to 0 in both. The implementation computes the
// cancelled form; the header says what it is equal to.
//
// The shade's estimate of the direct light at q, given the final reservoir's
// sample and weight W (metal/passes/restir_di/restir_di.metal.h, step 6):
//
//   L_direct = f(wo, wi) |cos θ_x| L_e max(cos θ_y, 0) a / d^2 x V x T x W
//
// V the sample's visibility from q, which the shade has from its own
// shadow ray, from a recent test it reuses, or, in raytraced mode, from the
// merges' invariant (metal/reuse/unbiased.metal.h): the caller's, applied
// by not calling this where V is 0. T is the transmittance of the medium
// the path is in over d (contract 12), 1 in air. The shade evaluates the
// same unpacked surface the target weighed, so the target is the
// integrand without V and T exactly, at every pixel.
//
// The light sample is evaluated at the point its identity holds,
// everywhere, the candidates' weights included: the decoded point
// (contracts/light_sample.h), so the density a candidate is weighed by is
// its own point's. That point is its cell's representative, which is the
// quantization's small bias, stated there.
//
// Pure functions of their arguments, inline, nothing read from memory: the
// surface and the light's answer are in registers (F.8: pure functions, so
// any pass may evaluate them in any order and get the same).
//
// Cost, per evaluation: one BSDF evaluation (contract 2: a few dozen flops
// for the conductor's GGX, fewer for the others), the light's answer
// (evaluate_light_point(): the point's decoding, a transform, a
// normalization, and 76 bytes of the light's data loaded), and a dozen
// flops more. Unpacking a record (decoding wo and the normal, widening four
// halves: two square roots and a few dozen flops) is paid once per record
// a pass loads, by unpack_record(), not once per evaluation, where the
// caller holds the unpacked surface; the merges' Frame, which is given
// records, unpacks per evaluation, ALU it trades for registers.
// metal/passes/restir_di/restir_di.metal.h counts the evaluations a pixel
// makes.
